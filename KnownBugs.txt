# Known Bugs & Limitations - VLAR Project
Authors: [Your Names]

1. Refresh Rate (UI):
   - The User Interface (HTML/JS) does not automatically refresh after a transaction is confirmed. 
   - Workaround: The user must manually refresh the page to see the updated status (e.g., milestone change).

2. Decimal Precision:
   - Prices are calculated in Wei. In rare edge cases of division for the 10% / 40% splits, there might be a tiny dust remainder (1-2 Wei) left in the contract due to Solidity's integer division.

3. Gas Estimation:
   - Occasionally, Metamask might overestimate the gas fees for the "approveAuthentication" function if the network is congested, showing a high fee warning.

4. Image Hosting:
   - The project uses simple URL links for NFT metadata. If the external link (IPFS/Cloud) goes down, the image might not load in the gallery.

5. Verifier Restriction:
   - Currently, only the contract owner can add new "Authorized Verifiers". There is no decentralized voting mechanism to remove a bad verifier.

6. Hardcoded Royalties:
   - The royalty percentage is fixed at 10% in the smart contract and cannot be changed dynamically after deployment.
